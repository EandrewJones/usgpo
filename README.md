# usgpo

This repository contains the scripts for a proto-R package that acts as a wrapper around the US Government Publishing Office's bulk data repository [API](https://github.com/usgpo/api). The aim is to streamline the user-interface for the API and automate away idiosyncratic errors associated with large requests.

Right now, there are only function to extract granular data for Congressional Bills. Expanded functionality for other collections and better documentation are forthcoming.
